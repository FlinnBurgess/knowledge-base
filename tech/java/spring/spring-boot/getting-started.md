# Getting Started

### Spring Initalizr

Spring initializr can be found at start.spring.io, and provides a convenient way of generating a baseline spring application configuration. For example if you are planning on using Maven, it will generate a `pom.xml` for you.

### Group

The group is similar to a Java package

### Artifact

The artifact is basically the name of the application/class

### Starters

Starters are dependencies you can add to your spring boot application which bring in a load of dependencies related to a particular purpose, for example web development.
