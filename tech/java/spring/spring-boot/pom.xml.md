# pom.xml

pom stands for project object model, and acts as a setup file for the project.

### Parent

The parent tag allows us to inherit the pom of another application. A common parent used in spring boot is `spring-boot-starter-parent`

### Dependencies

Dependencies, rather predictably, lists the dependencies of the application. Most IDEs will automatically import any dependencies into your project when you add dependency tags to your pom.xml
