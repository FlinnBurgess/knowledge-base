# Databases

### Config

Database configuration goes in the `settings.py` file of the project.

`ENGINE` indicates the type of database you want to use

`NAME` is the name of the database

For non-SQLite databases:

`USER`

`PASSWORD`

`HOST`

### Remember to create a database

If you're using anything other than SQLite then you need to remember to create a database by running `CREATE db_name` before running the project.
