# Packages

### Dependencies

The `pubspec.yaml` file manages the assets and dependencies of your project. You can add an entry such as

```yaml
english_words: ^3.1.0
```

which specifies that your project depends on the package english\_words version 3.1.0 and higher.

### Importing

You add an import statement to the top of your file. It has the following structure:

```dart
import 'package:english_words/english_words.dart';
```
