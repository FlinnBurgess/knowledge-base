# Gloomhaven

## Rules that are easy to miss

### Difficulty level

The formula is: Avg party level **divided by two**, rounded up

### Long rests

* The healing effect from long rests can cure wound/poison

### AOE

* Getting an extra target does not allow you to apply the AOE effect again, it just lets you hit a single other monster within range with the attack, but they must be outside the area of the first attack
* You can use the mirror image of the described area

### Movement

* You can move 0 hexes

### Monster movement

* Monsters will prioritise avoiding traps/hazardous terrain over attacking an enemy unless it is the only way they can eventually reach an enemy \(given infinite movement ability\)
* Considering the above point, this makes trap laying abilities useful because they can force enemies to take long routes

### Terrain

* Hazardous terrain deals `(2 + L)/2` damage when moved onto, but does not deal any more damage while standing on it
* Monsters treat hazardous terrain the same as traps

### Element infusion

* If your ability causes an elemental infusion then it cannot be skipped
* **However**, you can skip **consuming** an elemental infusion if you want
* Monsters consume an element _as a group_. i.e. it doesn't only affect the first monster to consume it.

### Retaliate

* Only applies if the monster being attacked survives
* Retaliate is not an attack, so is not blocked by shield

### Persistent bonus

* Items with slots that give EXP only grant that EXP when the token moves off of the slot
