# Welcome to Craft

> 👋 Hi There! Thanks for downloading Craft! In this doc you can read more about **how Craft can help you**, and how **it’s different to other tools** out there.

---

Craft is a tool for capturing and sharing your thoughts. What differentiates Craft from other tools is that it:

- Allows you to 📝 **write** and 🔖 **structure** content **the way you want to** - whether it be linear, structured, or a collection of linked/connected notes.
- Is ***blazing fast*** and works both **offline** and **online** - no more 🌀spinners!
- Has simple and frictionless ways to **share** and 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **collaborate.**
- Has powerful **export** options so you can integrate it into your existing 🛠 tools.

In short, that’s what Craft is. It’s a tool we’ve built with great care and attention to detail — something we hope will help you capture, organize and share your thoughts in a way that brings a 😄 on your face, rather than a 😡

# How Craft is different

Craft has a number of features that differentiate it from other note/document apps you are probably using today. The most important are :

1. # Structured & Linked notes
> #### In short : Craft allows you to nest notes within notes - creating your own structure - and making thoughts ::easier to group and organize::. It also allows you to easily create links and connections between pages via @page links.

While this might sound complicated at first, it’s actually very easy - **it’s not that different from how websites are built.** I.e., imagine Wikipedia.com as a single page document - it would be quite hard to find what you are looking for. So instead, it’s organized into pages - which makes it easier to consume and navigate.

Pages are organized in a hierarchy (i.e., Countries / Cities / New York) and can also link to each other where it makes sense - all of this allowing us to effortlessly navigate and browse content.

---

With Craft, you can do this on your phone and computer without having to learn web development - i.e., the document you are reading now is an example of this.

2. # Frictionless sharing & Export
You can use Craft in many ways - you can take notes for yourself, but also share and collaborate in real time with others.

- > **You can share your content via a (secret) link**. You can customize if you want people with the link to be able to add comments or not. Also - our web share is beautiful - your content will look professional and easy to read.
- > **You can collaborate in real time** with others on a document via **Spaces**. To do so, just create a space, invite others, and you are ready to go.

---

Apart from providing an amazing collaboration experience in Craft, we wanted to make sure your content isn’t locked in, and you can use Craft alongside the tools you already love. To enable this, we’re supporting a large number of **export formats** :

1. > **Email** export - which looks great. You can create newsletter quality emails just by using Craft.
2. > **Markdown** and **Textbundle** export - so you can start writing in Craft and transfer your content to other tools.
3. > **PDF** and **Print** Export - These are pixel perfect, and the end result will look exactly like what you see on your screen
4. > We are continuously adding new formats, and we will soon add RTF, Word, and Image export options.

3. # Works anywhere, anytime
Craft is an amazing app to use on :

- iPhones
- iPads
- Macs

Either :

- **Online** or
- **Offline** - you don't need an internet connection to view or edit Craft documents - it will sync changes once you are connected

---

Many products claim that they work great across all these form factors - but few actually do. We wanted to make sure that **Craft doesn**’**t** “**just**” **work on your Apple devices - but provides the best possible experience** on all of these platforms.

This means that you can use Craft anywhere you are with the same ease and productivity. You can use Craft ::on the go::, ::in bed,:: or ::at your desk:: - you no longer need to switch tools as you move between devices.

---

Craft **also always stores all your documents on your device as well**- so these are always available independent from your network connection. More than that - **you can keep writing** even without an internet connection, and Craft will upload changes once you’re back online.

You can also easily access and restore previous versions - should you want to go back in time.

4. # Visual content as a first class citizen
Most writing apps don’t treat images and videos as first class citizens. We believe that both are just as important a part of creating and sharing content as text — so we made sure Craft integrates media beautifully.

You can easily insert Photos or Videos :

In a way that is both pleasing and functional.

5. # … And all the small details

We’ve made sure the Craft is “crafted” so it deserves this name 🤓 - it's built with Love, Care, and Attention to even the smallest details - with the goal of providing you a frictionless and magical experience - so you can focus on your writing - and not the tool you are using.

---

Craft isn’t a web app ported to run on your iOS or macOS devices - it’s built from the ground up to feel at home on each platform — fully utilising the power, capabilities, and integrations that each provide.

---

This is the final ✨ touch, which we believe makes Craft stand out from the crowd of other document and note taking apps - and something you can only truly experience by using it. Those who try it never want to go back again…
